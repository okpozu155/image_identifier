# image_identifier
This Dockerized application utilizes the ViLT (Vision-and-Language Transformer) model, specifically ViltProcessor and ViltForQuestionAnswering, to process both images and text together. It allows the user to ask a question about an image, and the model provides an answer based on visual content and the accompanying text input.
